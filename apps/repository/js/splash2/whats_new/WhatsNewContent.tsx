                    <div className="intro">

                        <p>
                            This release mostly focused on improving stability
                            and implementing a few key UI features.  This
                            upgrades us to Electron 5.x which as needed for
                            some users who were experiencing severe latency
                            using Polar on Linux.  We also resolve a key issue
                            with non-atomic writes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This includes a good chunk of the new sharing
                            functionality but it's not enabled yet.
                        </p>


                    </div>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Big upgrade to latest version of Electron. Electron v5.0.0, Chromium v73.0.3683.119, Node v12.0.0, v8 v7.3.492.27-electron.0. This should hopefully fix a major latency issue some users were seeing on Ubuntu/Linux.

                        </li><li>Major performance fix on large PDFs.  Scrolling should be dramatically improved.  There's still a small latency issue we're seeing but already performance is dramatically improved.

                        </li><li>Enabled atomic writes again for all platforms.

                        </li><li>Filtering for tags now lists the tags alphabetically

                        </li><li>Right click on text highlight now add 'scroll into view'

                        </li><li>Upgraded to latest version of Typescript 3.4.3

                        </li><li>Fixed regression where progress wasn't being updated when progress messages were being sent from the renderer process.

                        </li><li>Fixed bug which resorted in two file uploads to firebase while cloud sync was operational. For large files this was very painful and resorted in 2x data being uploaded.

                        </li><li>Fixed bug where the UI would break when both filtering and removing tags on a document that was visible.

                        </li>
                        <li>Increased the sidebar a bit to accommodate updating comments without overflow of the summernote bar.

                        </li>
                        <li>Using the same account widget on web + desktop now.</li>

                            This release mostly focused on our Crowdfunding campaign but the full
                            changelog from 1.16.0 is below.  We're actively working on 1.18.0 which
                            will include a number of really exciting features to stay tuned!

                        <li>
                            <p>Significant refactor to allow us to use direct URLs which we can calculate
                                instead of having to use Firebase metadata + URL calculation which was very
                                slow and latent.  Sometimes up to 7500ms for fetching metadata.  Now requests
                                here are consistently 200ms and sometimes 0ms if we're fairly certain the URL
                                exists (when the client is fully sync'd).</p>

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <p>New support for attachments in DocInfo and the ability for attachments to
                                just be a bucket + file ref...</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Integrated the net promoter score to prompt once per week so we get more NPS

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed blob streams when replicating from the cloud back to disk.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Webapp now supports range queries for fetching PDFs rather than fetching the
                                entire document.  MASSIVE performance improvement here.</p>

                    <h3>Polar 1.16.0</h3>

                    <div className="intro">

                        <p>A number of major changes went into Polar 1.16.0 but
                            the big highlights include a big performance bump
                            for the desktop app on startup, an updated
                            chrome extension to improve stability during
                            loading PDFs, and a new context menu for the
                            document repository.</p>

                        <p>
                            This also includes a new timing system which allows
                            us to detect slow operations in Polar to help improve
                            performance over time.  The plan is to keep an
                            eye on these metrics to help track down any performance
                            regressions and also to improve performance over time.

                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed major performance issue with the datastore on Electron as it was going
                                through the IPC process for the datastore data reads and this was amazingly
                                slow. Moving it into the renderer process speeds up reads by about 10x.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed bad bug in the webapp where we wouldn't ever fetch the latest docs from
                                firebase.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>A ton of improvement to tooltips needed for mobile support but also the fact
                                that having them popup bothered a lot of users.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Inline app message that styling with rich HTML is supported for new users.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed bag bug where Firebase batches weren't used properly and we had a
                                delete outside of the batch which could leave FB inconsistent.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Always show the multi-delete and multi-tag buttons even if just one is
                                selected as it will still work just fine.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Make the top buttons for tagging and delete permanently displayed not hidden.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Added a couple key metrics for Firebase performance via tracer so that we can

                                just silently fails.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>RendererAnalytics now supports using a stopwatch so we can track the times
                                of important operations.</p>

                            Polar 1.15.0 is a big release for us.  We're calling

                            and easily saves them to Polar.

                        <p>
                            We will discuss this more in the coming days and

                            releasing the initial versions now so we can get

                            <p>Cut down memory usage of the webapp from 1GB to about 200MB.  The gmail app
                                is about 120MB so this isn't far off from being 'reasonable' in terms of
                                memory usage.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Upgraded to latest versions of Firebase and Webpack</p>

                        <p>
                        This is a small release from perspective of desktop
                        users but this also adds support for the new web app
                        which is actually live now but I'm not yet ready to
                        give out the URL just yet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The biggest change is that you can now create
                            highlights through pagemarks without them
                            interfering in your workflow.  Only the corners
                            are resizable now but other than that you can
                            work directly with the document.
                        </p>

                    <ul>

                        properly pick the right tags or create tags</li>

                        <li>Update to Electron 3.1.5</li>

                        <li>Pagemarks now allow you to work through them and
                        still can highlight and create + delete annotations now
                        without the pagemarks getting in the way.</li>

                        <li>A number of changes needed to get the webapp version
                        of Polar to work.</li>

                        <p>
                            This release focuses mostly on improving the reading
                            management capabilities in Polar.  We now support
                            pagemark modes and can change the colors of the
                            pagemark based on the mode.  Additionally, we have
                            statistics for tracking the number of pages you read
                            per day and an integrated calendar chart showing
                            this visually in the stats page.

                    <div className="intro">

                        <h4>Changelog:</h4>

                        <p>
                            Version 1.11 has fewer features than our normal weekly
                            releases. The next release will take a bit longer and we
                            wanted to get a version released sooner rather than
                            later.
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Feature: More consistent header bar throughout the app.
                            </li>

                            <li>Feature: Pagemark batches which help working with
                                PDFs that have multiple pages.  Now if you create
                                pagemarks across pages you can delete one and the whole
                                batch is also deleted.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Feature: Page number in markdown export
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Feature: Disabled the top message boxes.  They were
                                annoying and only a stop gap until we have a proper
                                onboarding mechanism.
                            </li>

                            <li> Bug: Fixed bug with page zoom not working properly
                                in the HTML viewer.  The zoom now works but pagemarks
                                still aren't placed properly. </li>

                            <li>
                                Upgrade: Electron 3.1.2
                            </li>

                            <li> Donate and Discord buttons in header.  These are
                                important. </li>

                            <li>

                                should disable hardwawre acceleration now if that's
                                causing a problem for you.

                    <iframe width="560" height="315"
                            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5SU31cT4DQ"

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 1.10 release again focused on a number of medium-scale
                        features but also improves stability across the board.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Updated UI</h4>

                    <p>
                        The most obvious feature is that the UI has been
                        significantly updated to support a new fixed header
                        bar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the motivations for this was that users were
                        getting confused when using the app for the first time
                        and didn't know how to add content.  Now there's a
                        large '+ Add' button front and center which is a clear
                        call to action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, the added space allows for selecting multiple
                        items.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Tagging Multiple Items</h4>

                    <p>
                        You can now tag multiple items in the UI by holding
                        down shift (or control) and then clicking on the items
                        you want to modify.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Shift allows you to select a range and control allows
                        you to select one at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the top left a new 'tag' button will pop up and you
                        can then assign tags to multiple documents at once.
                        This is very handy for new users that want to bulk-tag
                        multiple documents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, you can now sort by tags and if you hit the
                        'tags' column header at the top, twice, you can see
                        untagged documents and then tag them in bulk.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This can be used when importing a large number of documents
                        at once that all have the same tags.
                    </p>

                    <h4>New Exporter Framework</h4>

                    <p>
                        Many users requested the ability to easily export
                        annotations from Polar and we've shipped an initial
                        implementation of exporting content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note that you have always had the ability to export the
                        raw content in JSON form but this is designed to make
                        exports more usable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the annotation sidebar there's a new button for
                        'Export' which allows you to write the annotations to
                        JSON or Markdown.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Right now it only supports writing to a file but we're
                        also going to implement support for writing to the
                        clipboard as HTML format for easily posting your
                        annotations to your blog, Twitter, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The plan is to enable exporting in the 'annotation'
                        view which would allow you to export all your annotations
                        based any filters you define.  This would allow you
                        to preview the annotations and then export them in bulk
                        without having to open up a specific document.

                       Bug: Fixed (I hope) long standing ugly bug of 'crash' of Electron on app exit due
                        to windows not being destroyed via destroy().  Close does not release the

                        long and couldn't be represented on the filesystem.  We not truncate at 50

                <h3>Polar 1.9</h3>


                <div className="intro">

                    <p>
                        Polar 1.9.0 was just released. This release is mostly focused around stability and fixes a number of important bugs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One big new feature went into this release though - you’re now able create pagemarks across multiple pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here’s the excerpt from the documentation:</p>

                    <p>When you right click and select “Create Pagemark to Point” Polar creates
                        pagemarks over all previous pages up until the previous pagemark (or the
                        beginning) of the document.</p>

                    <p>This enables you to import a book which you’ve been reading and mark multiple
                        pages as read so that you can now just use Polar to track your pgoress.</p>

                    <p>For example, if you have a 300 page book, and you’ve read pages 1-200 you can
                        just jump to page 200 and “Create Pagemark to Point” and pagemarks will be
                        created across all previous pages.</p>

                    <p>You can still pagemark the current page by selecting “Create Pagemark Box” to
                        or run “Control Alt N” to mark just the current page.</p>

                    <h4>Changelog:</h4>

                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            <p>Create pagemark to point now works across multiple pages and ranges.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed bad bug where the UI wouldn’t update when a newly imported PDF wasn’t
                                immediately visible in the UI. This was a bad initial user experience as they
                                would have to reload for the PDFs to be visible.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed major Twitter content capture bug where we weren’t saving the CSS styles
                                of HTML content.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed bug where VH rules that were less than 100 weren’t being set properly
                                and some pages rendered ugly.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fixed bug with the ‘deck:’ tag not properly working with Anki sync.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Importing large numbers of PDFs (and large PDFs) is now a lot faster and more
                                responsive when using cloud storage.  In the past we used to wait until the
                                cloud layer was finished but this takes a long time to complete.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Now using ‘localhost’ instead of ‘localapp.getpolarized.io’ for the hostname.
                                Some users weren’t able to resolve this (not sure why) and additionally
                                working offline didn’t function either.</p>
                        </li>

                <h3>Polar 1.8</h3>

                <div className="intro">

                    <p>
                        This release concentrated on a number of smaller features
                        requested by users plus fit and finish.  The major changes
                        include refactoring the text editor so that it's more
                        clear that it supports rich text and formatted HTML.
                        We also now support cloze deletions for Anki which was
                        a big feature for a lot of users but required a big
                        refactor.  Additionally we have a new logs view so that
                        you can monitor the internal behavior of Polar during
                        sync (and other) operations.  You can also copy the entire
                        log to the clipboard for reporting bugs to the Polar
                        developers.

                        mode so that users can realize that it supports rich text.</li>

                        <li>Support for cloze deletion</li>

                        <li>Stats view for core stats</li>

                        what's happening with their data.</li>

                        <li>Related tags in the tag selector</li>

                        <li>'capturing' a PDF from the browser now works and the PDF is then saved into

                        <li>  Adding forced CSS for ::selection so that sites that have broken CSS for
                        highlighting don't actually break polar and we also have consistent highlight

                            Polar now supports cloud sync powered by Firebase.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Cloud sync is real-time - as soon as you make a change to a
                        local document it is immediately synchronized to the
                        cloud and then to the other computers you have which run
                        Polar.
                    </p>

                    <p>Cloud sync is free for smaller instances and <b>$7.99</b> for
                        users with more than 100 documents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To ensure data safety we now support local lightweight
                        backups of your data. We take backups at critical points
                        including just before you synchronize for the first
                        time.

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Polar 1.1 is fresh out the door and a lot of amazing features and
                        bug fixes are enabled in this release.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The biggest feature by far is our support for
                        the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-polar/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd">'Save to Polar' chrome extension</a> that
                        allows you to send the URL of your active tab to Polar
                        for content capture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This makes it a lot easier to work with Polar as you can
                        just click a button in Chrome and have it sent to Polar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We plan on adding support for Safari, and Firefox in the
                        future but we're taking things one step at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-center">

                    </p>

                    <h3>Other features in 1.1 include:</h3>

                    <li>
                        Disabling amp for now until we have a better solution on how to show the user
                        that an AMP page is displayed and how to disable / enable it.  Otherwise its
                        confusing and often the amp page is WORSE not better.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bugs with the browser size not changing during capture browser changing
                        and also fixed some issues with it not properly accepting the browser change
                        in some situations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bug in HTML zoom where the page would be truncated improperly.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Blocked amp ads during the capture but they aren't blocked during the preview
                        at the moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        "Fixed" nasty anti-aliasing bug in electron by blocking amp ads. They were
                        annoying anyway but for some reason they were breaking chrome rendering -
                        probably due to some web component nonsense.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Implemented a new strategy with the vertical height algorithm in the capture
                        system to revert it back to auto instead of a fixed max-height.  Works a lot
                        better now.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Date/times no longer include ' ago' to be a bit more concise.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Added small FAQ entry to enable Anki sync.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed a bug where we could select text and not properly work with elements.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Renderer analytics didn't understand that a callback without an error wasn't
                        a failure.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Upgraded a number of important react packages:
                        react react-dom react-moment react-select @types/react-table
                        @types/react-select @types/react @types/prop-types @types/node-fetch
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        removed inversify package (were not using it)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        latest fontawesome
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        latest node-fetch
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        fixed issue with electron-builder where it was forcing us to upgrade to the
                        latest version for each release.
                    </li>
